        Enigma objects are instantiated with a dictionary of settings for all elements of the machine.
        The enigma_encode method is called with a string containing the cypher text to be encoded/ decoded.
        The method processes the Enigma object settings with a Settings object and instantiates 
         rotor, reflector and plugboard objects that have encoding methods.
        It then processes the input string and starts encoding letter by letter until it reaches the end of the string.
        It calls the encode functions arranged in the correct order and passes the result to the next one.
        It also calls step_rotors() method to simulated the movements of the rotors considering the current positions and mapped notches.
        Finally, it appends the character to an output string and returns the encoded/ decoded text.
